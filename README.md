# Go-WindowsDefender_Killer
A golang binary meant to disable microsoft windows defender with multiple methods. 

# Disclaimer
This was a tool I was using earlier that was working on some WindowsDefender versions, I'm just releasing it now for no reason.

# Compile and Build
Compile the go binary by running `make` command with `release` argument for stripped release or `debug` argument for debug binary.

```bash
make release #Release version
make debug #Debug version
```
